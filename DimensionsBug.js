This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions. The issue arises when the dimensions are accessed before the component has fully mounted, resulting in `undefined` values. This often leads to crashes or unexpected behavior in calculations or layout adjustments.  ```javascript
// Incorrect usage
const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');
// ... use width and height
```
